    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I’ve spent my career developing a skillset based on bridging the gap between people and systems. I’m a serial problem-solver, an unapologetic generalist, and the get-it-done person in every organization I join. I started my career in the non-profit sector in program management, fundraising, and coaching, where I became very familiar with getting things done with limited resourcing while problems and organizations grew increasingly complex. 
        </p>
        <p>I then fell in love with tech and the fast-paced, high-impact nature of startups, helping to stand up people operations and recruiting functions at two different Series A companies. I’ve managed operational teams at 30-person startups and 60K+ fast-growing enterprises. I’ve navigated nuanced and difficult client/donor/vendor relations in non profits and professional services. 
        </p>
        <p>And wherever I go, I find the same principle to be true: that companies are only as effective and healthy as their leaders. And now I’m looking to take on my next challenge in helping a company with heart scale to its next chapter by unblocking leaders and breaking down organizational silos.
